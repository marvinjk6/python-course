# Getting started with Functions

### Function:

- A reusable piece of code. Example: def product_of_two_numbers(a,b):

### Parameter:

- A named entity in a function definition that specifies an argument the function can accept.
  Example: In def product_of_two_numbers(a,b):, a and b are parameters.

### Argument:

- The actual value that is passed to a function when it is invoked/called. <br>
  Example: In the call product_of_two_numbers(1,2), 1 and 2 are argument

### Function Declaration:

- The act of defining a function's name, parameters, and body. It doesn't run the function but sets it up to be called later

### Function Invocation:

- The act of running a function by using its name followed by arguments in parentheses.
  Example: product_of_two_numbers(2,3)

### Return Value:

- The value a function sends to calling function. return a \* b

### Built-in Function:

- Functions that are always available in Python. Example: max(5,6)

### Keyword <strong>pass</strong>:

- The pass statement is a no-operation statement in Python. It is used when a statement is syntactically required but you do not want to perform any operation.
- It acts as a placeholder and allows the code to pass without executing any specific instructions.

### Section Quiz

1. Why are functions beneficial in programming?

- This is one of the primary benefits of functions. By encapsulating specific tasks or logic within a function, that logic can be reused in multiple places, making the codebase more maintainable and organized.

2. In Python, how do you define a function?

- In Python, functions are defined using the def keyword, followed by the function name and parentheses.

3. What is the purpose of the return keyword in the function? return a \* b

- The primary purpose of the return keyword here is to send the calculated value (product of a and b) back to the caller.

4. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument in the context of functions?

- A parameter acts as a placeholder or variable that represents the expected input to the function. On the other hand, an argument is the actual value provided to the function when it is invoked.

5. Which statement best describes the term 'Function Invocation'?

- Function invocation refers to the process of calling or running a previously defined function using its name followed by parentheses containing any necessary arguments.

6. What is the main benefit of default function arguments in Python?

- Default arguments allow a function to be called without explicitly providing values for certain arguments, which can simplify function calls and make the function more versatile.

# Getting Started with Python Programming - Summary

### Built-in Functions:

- Explored essential built-in functions: print(), abs(), pow(), max(), and min()

### Basic Math Operations:

- multiplication (\*),
- addition (+),
- subtraction (-),
- division (/),
- exponentiation(\*\*),
- remainder(%)

### Text:

- Should be within double or single quotes - 'Hello World' or "Hello World"

### Expressions ( 5 \* 4 \* 50):

- \* is an operator, and 5, 4 and 50 are operands. 5, 4 and 50 are also called literals because these are constant values. Their values don't really change.

### Statement:

- A unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. For example, print(5).

### Calling a Function:

- Invoking or initiating a function using its name and parentheses. For example, print(5).

### Argument:

- A value provided to a function when called. Ex: print(5), 5 is an argument.

### Scape sequences

Explored escape sequences (\n, \t, \\) to insert special characters into strings.

### Section Quiz

1. Which function is used to display text in Python?

   - print() function is the standard built-in function in Python to display text (and other data types) to the console.

2. What is Python named after?

   - Python's name is a tribute to the British comedy group "Monty Python." Guido van Rossum, the creator of Python, wanted a name that was short, unique, and slightly irreverent, so he named the language after his favorite comedy group.

3. What is the purpose of using quotes around text in the print function?

   - Quotes (either single ' or double " quotes) are used to define string literals in Python.

4. Which of the following codes will output the value 50?

   - print((5+5) \* 5)

5. Which of the following codes will output the value 50 <br>  
   print(10 % 3)

   - 10 % 3 returns the remainder when 10 is divided by 3, which is 1.

6. In the expression 5 \* 6, what is the operator?

   - In this expression, the asterisk (\*) is the operator, which represents multiplication.

7. What purpose does the character # serve in Python code?

   - The # character is used to start a comment in Python. Any text following this character on the same line is ignored by the Python interpreter.

8. What is the output of the following code? <br>
   print(abs(-10.5)) <br>

   - The abs() function returns the absolute value of the given number. The absolute value of -10.5 is 10.5.

9. What does the pow() function do in Python?

   - The pow() function is used to raise one number to the power of another. For example, pow(2, 3) would return 8 (because 2\*\*3 = 8).

10. Which of the following is the correct definition of "Argument" based on the terminology given?

    - An argument is a value that you pass into a function when you call it. It provides input to the function so that it can perform its operations and potentially return a result.

11. Given the following code, what will be the output? <br>
    print(max(34, 45, 67))
    - 67 which is the higher number

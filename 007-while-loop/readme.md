# While Loop in Python

### while loop

- In a while loop, we specify a logical condition. While the condition is true, the loop continues running.

### break statement

- The break statement is used to exit a loop when a specific condition is met.

### continue statement

- The continue statement is used to skip the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration.

### Remember

- Always remember to increment the variable used in the while loop condition. Forgetting to do this can result in an infinite loop.

### for vs while

- Use a for loop when you know the number of iterations in advance.
- Use a while loop when the number of iterations is determined by a condition that may change during execution.

### Section Quiz

1. What does a while loop do in Python?

- A while loop checks a condition and, as long as it remains true, will continuously execute the enclosed block of code. It will stop executing once the condition evaluates to false.

2. What does the break keyword do in a loop?

- The break keyword is used to exit or break out of a loop prematurely when a certain condition is met, regardless of whether the loop's main condition is still true.

3. In the context of a while loop, what is the primary purpose of the continue keyword?

- The continue keyword is used to skip the remaining part of the current iteration and proceed directly to the next iteration of the loop.

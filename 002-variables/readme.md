# Variables Introduction

### Variable

- Fundamental data storage units in Python that hold values. Value of variables can change over the runtime of a program.

### Defining, Declaring or Creating a Variable

- Giving a variable a name and an initial value

### Assignment - Atribuir

- The process of assigning a value to a variable using the = operator (In programming, the = symbol doesn't denote equality as in mathematics but represents assignment. The value of the expression on the right-hand side is assigned to the variable on the left - hand side. )

### Choosing Good Names

- Choose meaningful and descriptive names for variables based on their purpose
- variable names cannot start with numbers

### Case Sensitivity

- Variable names are sensitive to uppercase and lowercase. 'Count' and 'count' would be two different variables.

### Compound Operators

- +=
- -=
- \*=
- /+
- //=
- %=
- \*\*=
